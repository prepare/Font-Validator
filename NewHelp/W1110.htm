<P><B><I>glyf</I>: Intersecting components of composite glyph</B></P>
<P>The glyph indicated in the validation log contains contours of glyph components that intersect (overlap). This type of glyph design introduces some ambiguity in terms of defining what is the 'inside' and 'outside' of a glyph shape, and may cause a rasterizer to reverse the overlapped portion. This problem is generally seen on older printers. Although Microsoft discourages this type of glyph design, for legacy reasons this overlap is allowed for composite glyphs.<BR><BR><IMG ALIGN="TOP" BORDER=1 SRC="intersection_component_whole_scaled.jpg">&#160;<IMG ALIGN="TOP" BORDER=1 SRC="intersection_component_detail_scaled.jpg"><BR><BR>The current implementation of the rasterizer as well as many legacy versions handle this exception and ensures that the overlap between components is filled.<BR><BR>Please note that for consistency and predictability across platforms and implementation of the rasterizer, composite glyphs with overlapping contours should be redrawn altogether as a single glyph.</P>
